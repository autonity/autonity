Genesis File
============

The genesis file is a JSON_ formatted file that is the source of all network
level configuration for Autonity.  We can think of a genesis file as defining a
network, and any entity that wishes to join the network must obtain a copy of
the genesis file and initialise their Autonity client with it in order to join
the network.

.. _JSON: https://www.json.org/json-en.html

Generating a genesis file
-------------------------

To generate a genesis file you can use the following commands run from the root
of the repository.

First ensure the gengen tool is built:

.. code-block:: bash

   make all

Then generate a genesis file with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./build/bin/gengen --min-gas-price 10 --user 1e12,v,1,:6789 --user 1e12,v,1,:6799 --user-keys userkeys --out-file genesis.json

This builds a genesis file with a network of 2 users that are validators, the
private keys for the users will be stored in the file ``userkeys`` in the order
that users are specified on the commandline.

The tool has comprehensive built-in help, that can be viewed by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./build/bin/gengen --help

If you look at the genesis file generated by gengen you will see some fields
whose values were not provided to gengen. This is because there are many fields
that are not actually made use of by the Autonity project but are, nonetheless,
required in order for the ethereum virtual machine to function properly and so
need to remain as part of the genesis file. Also, depending on the way the
JSON_ encoding is specified, fields that are unset can appear with zero values
in the genesis file. Additionally there are fields that are used by Autonity
but which either have only one reasonable value or need a randomised value.
These fields are set automatically.

Genesis file detailed description
---------------------------------


A full description of all the fields in the genesis file is provided below.
Fields are filled with zero values to give an idea of the type of data that
each field holds. Comments have been added in the file here for clarity, but
please note that comments are not permitted in valid JSON_.

..
 We set the highlight to text here since this is not valid json.

 The comment blocks were formatted by writing the comment without the preceding
 '// ' and then line wrapping to 80 chars and then prepending each line with
 '// '
